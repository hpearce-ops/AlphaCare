The two patterns used are the Composite Design Pattern and Password strength checker.

The Composite Design Pattern can be seen in the class structure and hierarchy.

The Component is the Login Interface that is found within the Login package.  
The Leaves are the model classes (Admin, Medical Personnel, and Patients)
The Composite is are the directories (that are created by the other classes, this is where the data is ultimately kept)
The Client are the controllers in the Controller package.

The Password Strength checker is found in the CreateUserView in the View package
